why versions are necessary

versioning principles:

	compatibility
	
		The meaning of a name should not change over time

		Go 1 compatibility
		
		diamond dependency

	repeatability
	cooperation

Principle 1: Import compatiblity rule:

	If an old package and a new package have the
	same import path, the new package must be
	backward compatible with the old package.

Principle 2: Repeatability

	The result of a build of a given version of a package
	should not change over time.

Principle 3: Cooperation

	We must all work together to maintain the Go ecosystem.
	Tools cannot work around a lack of cooperation.
	
	fragmentation vs healthy/thriving
